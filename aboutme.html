            I grew up in Memohis, Tn surely life wasn't easy but I pushed through it as much as possible. It has lead me upon many journeies that have changed my life and here lead me to
             <b>"Coding Developer"</b> This has been a great learning experience for me it has taught me more growth and patience to learn and develope. 
        </p>
        <p>Many may say coding is to hard, now dont get me wrong it has its share of difficulties but it is very much manageable with the willingness to learning the process.</p>
        <p>The key for me learnign coding was to to get it how i understood it i had to put things in my own prospective and apply what i was being taught to my projects that helped me out tremendously.</p>

            A other key thing that i have learned, is to be flexible in how im learning and processing info. I've learned that this gives me the ability to take in more info on a normal pace for me. The process may seem slow yet it's more effective and really allows me to move ahead more faster.
        </p>
        <p>
          Telling my family and loved ones bout how im learning this new coding to me it really excites them and they feels it gives a new hope for me and my future. This also has motivated me into learning and doing more for my family, but yet more so for myself.
